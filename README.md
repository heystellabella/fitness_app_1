## Challenges & Wins

Stella:

Challenges:
1. CSS styling for best way to display information i.e. weight page.
2. Getting information from the front end into the back end.

Wins:
1. CSS styling for consistency.
2. Retrieving information from the backend (db) to display on the page.

Clarence: 
1. The login and logout state of the app. 
    - Instead of building out large html elements using innerHTML - I had to refactor my code/components to be modular (Navbar, Subnav). Also, figuring out how to only render certain functions.
2. Sessions :(
    - Prior knowledge of sessions using it with Flask. Went down a lot of rabbit holes trying to understand it for Express. Once I discovered that sessions are stored in a new table in database, I created routes in the backend and an axios.get in the front end to pull the session variable to display the logged in users data.
3. Reinforcing knowledge of the Front-end and Back-end
    - When I challenged myself to add in the ExerciseDB API, I did not need to add this to the API/create a route. As this is being pulled from another server. This is purely a front-end call.

Haden:

Challenges: 
1. Find suitable CSS styling for section displa. 
2. Convert data type to match the frond end inputs and SQL table. 

Wins: 
1. Using aggregate and group by methods in SQL to retrieve information from database
2. Using CSS grid to design the page.
